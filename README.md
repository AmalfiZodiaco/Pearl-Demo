#Pearl Demo

This demo in Unity shows concretely how Pearl works.
The demo was created with NET 4.0 and Unity 2017 LTS.

For the Pearl API see the [repository](https://github.com/AmalfiZodiaco/Pearl-API)

The game starts from the StarMenu scene. The commands are:

w / a / d / s to walk and to attach q to use

If you attack the yellow square, a message will appear in the debug. If you press "use" on the yellow square, the life bar is halved.

In the game folder, Pearl's library is located in the "Pearl" folder, while the "_Game_" folder contains the contents of the specific demo.
